            <p id="second-para">I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of
                motivation that drives
                me to do my best. In my last job, this passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills
                that
                helped me to do better work. For example, I taught myself how to use Photoshop to improve the quality of
                our photos
                and graphics. I soon became the go-to person for any design needs.</p><br>

            <p>Slice the meat against the thick fiber 1 cm wide. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, let stand 15-20 minutes
                until it sinks in Heat margarin, saute the spices until fragrant and cooked. Add meat and change color.
                Put in the eggs, tomatoes and water. Then complete.!</p>

                <h3>Beaf Salad</h3>
                <p>Compile the salad on a bed of romaine lettuce topped with tomatoes, cucumbers, fresh cilantro, red
                    onion, and the beef. I like to make mine in layers so that the toppings are dispersed throughout the
                    salad. Pour the dressing generously over the salad before serving.</p>

                    with blended white beans, this healthy soup topped with fresh basil is rich in flavor and oh so
                    satisfying. And, it's done and ready to eat in 30 minutes!</p>

                <h3>Sausage Roll</h3>
                <p>Slice sausage roll into ½-inch patties at indicated marks. (For easier slicing, place sausage in
                    freezer for 10-15 minutes before slicing.)
                    Place patties in a cold skillet. Cook over MEDIUM heat for 14-16 minutes, turning sausage frequently
                    for even browning, or until center of sausage patty reaches 160°F and is no longer pink.
